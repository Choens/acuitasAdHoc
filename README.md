# Acuitas Ad Hoc Template Package

The actual template is available here:
https://gitlab.com/acuitas-health/ad-hoc-template

You can install this package with:
`devtools::install_gitlab("acuitas-public/acuitasadhoc")` from within R. Or, if
you have the template downloaded, `make install_custom_packages` from the shell.
The latter is possibly safer, because it ALSO makes sure you have devtools
installed because you can't install this without devtools, sorry.

This package provides useful support functions for the Acuitas Ad Hoc Template.

## Useful SQL Queries

I legit need to find a better place for these . . . . 


Create the table in Dev and Prod:

```sql
DROP TABLE AHDSSandbox.dbo.ReportsEmailLog

CREATE TABLE AHDSSandbox.dbo.ReportsEmailLog (
    date_sent date NULL,
    customer varchar(255) NULL,
    report varchar(255) NULL,
    report_description varchar(1024) NULL,
    stratification varchar(255) NULL,
    report_name varchar(512) NULL,
    recipient varchar(512) NULL,
    created_dt date NULL,
    sent int NULL
);
```

And to look at what we've got:

```sql
select * from AHDSSandbox.dbo.ReportsEmailLog rel
```

And to delete all the data:

```sql
delete from AHDSSandbox.dbo.ReportsEmailLog;
```
