Version 0.3 is released. This version is nearly feature complete.

The functions have been improved dramatically.

- Can run an arbitrarily large number of SQL queries and download the data.
- Can create an arbitrarily large number of reports based on the values of the
Stratification column.
- Can email these reports to an arbitrarily large number of people.
- Can log success/failure of emails sent.

As of today, this cannot yet be used on the RSC server because of a missing
dependency on the RSC box, so that has not been tested yet.

Prior versions of the package are not documented here . . . . and honestly,
nobody should really care. They weren't really ready for production.
